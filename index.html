        <h2>Semantics</h2>
        <h6>By Dr Seuss</h6>
        <p>Once upon a time, in a land far away,
            There were HTML tags, used day by day.
            They were used to make websites, big and small,
            But they were all just text, no structure at all.
            
            The website visitors, they got quite confused,
            They couldn't find what they were looking for, they mused.
            But then, one day, a wise man did say,
            "We need to use semantic tags, in HTML, hooray!"
            
            "With semantic tags, our website will shine,
            Visitors will know where to find what's fine.
            Headings, paragraphs, and links, oh my,
            All with their own tags, easy to find, oh spy!"
            
            So, they began to use semantic tags with glee,
            Their website was organized, as easy as can be.
            Visitors were happy, they found what they sought,
            And the website's ranking, it greatly was brought.
            
            So, remember, my friends, as you create your site,
            Use semantic tags, to make it just right.
            It will save you headaches, and make it just swell,
            And your visitors will thank you, as well.
            
            So, if you want your website to be a success
            Use semantic tags, without any fuss,
            Your website will be organized, easy to navigate
            And your visitors will be very glad you did it with semantic tags, it will be great!</p>
